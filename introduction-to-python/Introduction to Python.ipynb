    "The Python philosophy is summarized in a sequence of aphorisms known as [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). It gives a great importance to code readability and to the capacity to express concepts in few lines of code. The ability to produce good code in the sense of this philosophy comes with reading and writing code, a lot of code! Anyone who wants to produce Python code has to read the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out) and to deeply thinks about the advices given in this document. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library."
